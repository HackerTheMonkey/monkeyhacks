# monkeyhacks
This is a collection of solutions to programming problems, hacks, gotachas, data structures, algorithims, etc...

Currently the only programming language I am using is Java, I am hoping to have the time to add similar implementations in other programming languages for comparison.

- [TwoSum problem](https://github.com/HackerTheMonkey/monkeyhacks/blob/master/src/main/java/com/hackermonkey/twosome/problem.md)
  - Iterative Solution [time complexity = O(n^2), space complexity = O(1)]
  - A HashMap-backed solution with a single iteration [time complexity = O(n), space complexity = O(n)]
  - A HashMap-backed solution with a dual iteration [time complexity = O(n), space complexity = O(n)]
  
  TODO:
  - make sure that we are testing the worst case scenario for the HashMap-backed solution []
